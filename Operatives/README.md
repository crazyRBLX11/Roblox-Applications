# Operatives

Operatives is a game that I'm developing that is a story-based heist game. It will be similar to Entry Point and the Payday game series. I have provided three samples of code that are present in the lobby of the game.

- Atom-OPERATIVES-25112025.rbxm; A modified version of my Atom framework that contains some changes since the GitHub uploaded one, these changes will eventually be uploaded too once they've been finished.
- Client.lua; UI and Input script for the player character customisation, still heavily WIP. This requires Atom to work.
- Server.lua; Script that handles the actually customisation for the player, and eventually player teleportation, still heavily WIP. This requires Atom to work.
